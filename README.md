# Database branches

A Laravel-based experimental project for **parallel work with databases in isolated copies**,  
with the ability to later **merge all changes back into the main database**.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to build a tool that allows developers (or separate environments) to work with their own database copies (branches),  
while keeping the same schema. After work is completed, all changes can be merged into the original **main database**.
